# BulletHeck

A single-screen bullet-hell style game, in which you try to avoid the--astroids? enemy ships? missles? coming your way. Graphics are still just block sprites at this point, so feel free to use your imagination. Obstacle sprites gain speed and frequency the longer you place. Arrow buttons to move, esc to quit.

Programmed in Python using Pygame.
